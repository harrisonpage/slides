{"title": "Cheerleader", "description": "The image shows a young woman standing in a living room, wearing a cheerleader outfit: red sweater with the letter 'R' and 'CSJ' on it, a black skirt, white socks, and white shoes. She has short dark hair and glasses, with hands on hips. The room has a patterned armchair, a small television on a stand with a picture frame next to it, and a red curtain on the window. The walls are light-colored, and there is a small shelf with photos on the wall.", "color": "color", "images": ["/Users/harrison/scans/005/2025-07-21-15-49_0001x1920.jpg"], "hash": "ac2c8d72fa6399804629d46471b3c9ee", "ts": 1753463959.811404, "tags": ["sweater", "television", "living room", "cheerleader", "woman"], "date": "1960s"}
