{"title": "San Francisco Street View", "description": "The image depicts a street view in San Francisco from an elevated perspective, capturing a long incline and a series of vintage cars. The architecture includes mid-rise buildings with classic facades lining the street. Several construction workers are seen with orange flags near the bottom of the image, suggesting street work in progress. A slightly foggy atmosphere and distant cityscape add depth to the scene.", "color": "color", "images": ["/Users/harrison/scans/002/Hofbrau Vintage Slide California San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf Old Cars Fashion 1960s/72DPI/IMAG0011.JPG"], "hash": "078bfdcb644a4749fb9c295f0a4f21d3", "ts": 1751321935.5583339, "date": "circa 1960s", "tags": ["San Francisco", "street", "vintage cars"]}
